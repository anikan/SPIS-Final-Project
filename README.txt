1.We would like to combine image manipulation with computer vision to create a robot that uses the camera to take a photo, processes it to find specific colors/ motion and heads towards that direction. This could be used to look for differently colored objects, such as people in an environment. Motion sensing could be used to track and observe moving objects. We will also use the ultrasound sensor to make sure that it doesn't collide with anything. If possible, then the view from the robot will appear on the computer, modified, so that people could see why it is doing what it is doing.

2. We worked with raspberry pi before and also used image manipulation to create potential solutions to other problems.

3. We will learn to use the camera, and the motors of the robot. Besides that just clever thought is required.

TO RUN:
in terminal of RPi, type:"sudo python foresight.py"

Goals of the project:

    Create a robot that utilizes computer vision to detect objects or motion in its environment and move toward that object or motion
        Three modes:
            Darkest color detection
            Motion detection 
            Specific color detection
    Learn how hardware and software interact


Why these goals are interesting:

    Creating such a robot that can move toward objects or motion can be useful in real-world situations, such as disaster rescue, security, and monitoring people in need (the sick, young, or immobile).
    Understanding how hardware and software interact allows us to program machines that can do tasks we give them.


Challenges we overcame:

    Programming how the robot processes images from the environment
    Determining how to combine motor movement with image analysis


How we accomplished these goals:

    Trial and error
    Google
    Referencing documentation
